      location: 'Greenwich, CT',
      scope: '2,400 sq ft',
      type: 'Private Residence',
      architect: 'Chen Architecture',
      duration: '3 weeks',
      rooms: 'Foyer, dining room, powder room, stairwell',
      substrate: 'Original horsehair plaster, selectively repaired',
      challenge: 'The homeowners wanted to restore warmth to their 1920s colonial foyer while maintaining period authenticity. Previous contractors had applied modern joint compound over original horsehair plaster, creating an uneven surface that absorbed light poorly.',
      approach: 'We carefully removed the modern material, repaired the original substrate with compatible lime-based compounds, and applied a three-coat Venetian plaster system in a custom warm ivory tone. The finish was burnished to achieve the luminosity of Mayo Pearl — our signature polished Venetian.',
      result: 'The foyer now catches natural light beautifully throughout the day, with the plaster\'s depth revealing different tones as the sun moves. The clients describe it as "finally seeing the house as it was meant to be."',
      testimonial: 'Daragh understood exactly what we wanted. The finish catches afternoon light beautifully — it feels like the house finally has its soul back.',

      duration: '2 weeks',
      rooms: 'Great room, primary suite, guest bedrooms, hallways',
      substrate: 'New drywall, skim-coated',
      challenge: 'A contemporary beach house needed walls that could handle coastal humidity while providing a relaxed, organic aesthetic that connected the interior to the shoreline landscape.',
      approach: 'We applied our Sea Mist limewash — a breathable mineral finish that naturally regulates moisture. We built up thin layers to create depth and movement, allowing the natural variation inherent in limewash to express itself.',
      result: 'The walls breathe with the coastal air, never trapping moisture. The subtle variations create a living surface that changes with the light and seasons — calm in overcast weather, luminous when sun pours through.',
      testimonial: 'The lime wash was exactly right for the beach house. It feels like the walls are part of the landscape.',

      substrate: 'Existing tile and drywall',
      challenge: 'A high-end kitchen renovation required seamless, waterproof surfaces that could handle heavy use while maintaining a minimalist, contemporary aesthetic. The client wanted the feel of poured concrete without the cold, industrial edge.',
      approach: 'We applied Harbor Concrete microcement throughout — walls, countertops, and backsplash — creating a monolithic surface with no grout lines or seams. Multiple sealer coats ensure water resistance and durability for daily kitchen use.',
      result: 'The kitchen feels expansive and sculptural. The seamless surfaces are easy to clean and have proven extremely durable through daily family use — including three children under ten.',
      testimonial: 'The microcement transformed our kitchen into something you\'d see in a design magazine. And it\'s incredibly practical.',

      challenge: 'A National Register property required full restoration of failing original plaster. Previous patch repairs using modern materials had accelerated deterioration. The preservation committee required historically accurate materials and techniques.',
      approach: 'We stabilized salvageable original plaster using conservation injection techniques, then replaced failed sections with traditional three-coat lime plaster over wood lath. All materials were period-appropriate: natural hydraulic lime, local sand, and animal hair fiber.',
      result: 'The restoration passed preservation review on first submission. The new work is indistinguishable from the original 1892 plaster — matching in texture, hardness, and the way it takes light.',
      testimonial: 'Finding someone who understands both the materials and the preservation requirements is rare. Daragh delivered exactly what the house needed.',

      challenge: 'A new-construction estate required decorative plaster throughout the principal rooms. The architectural vision called for understated luxury — walls that would read as expensive without competing with the furnishings.',
      approach: 'We specified Louisburgh Silk — our satin-finish Venetian — in a custom warm neutral developed through six sample iterations. The soft glow provides depth without the mirror-like reflection of polished Venetian.',
      result: 'The plaster provides a consistent, refined backdrop throughout the home. The architects selected this project for their portfolio, citing the finish quality as instrumental to the overall effect.',
      testimonial: 'We specify decorative plaster on most of our residential projects. Daragh\'s sampling process and execution are why we keep calling.',

      result: 'The townhouse now feels like a completely different home. The walls have presence and personality while remaining quietly sophisticated.',
